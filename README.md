***Following are the Basic rules which are to be considered while playing the game:***

**Board Setup:**

The game is played on an 8x8 grid board.

Each player starts with two discs of their color placed diagonally in the center.

**Turns:**

Players take turns placing one disc of their color on an empty square.A player must place a disc so that it 'sandwiches' at least one opponent's disc between two of their own discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

**Flipping Discs:**

When a player surrounds the opponent's discs with their own on opposite sides, all the enclosed discs of the opponent's color are flipped to the current player's color.

**Passing:**

If a player has no legal moves, they must pass, and their opponent continues to play.

**End of the Game:**

The game ends when the board is full or when neither player can make a legal move.

The player with the most discs of their color on the board wins.

The player with the most discs of their color on the board at the end of the game is the winner.

**Tiebreaker:**

If both players have the same number of discs of their color, the game is a tie.
